We implemented the program using tokens in order to keep track of each command character in a more organized fashion. 

An overview of our code is as follows

Read in the input from the console and parse through it intially to remove all comments from the input

Next tokenize the input string in order to make a linked list of tokens (linked tokens) that all have a trait (eg AND, WORD) 
which allows them to be easily processed later in the code 

Once the linked tokens are made, we iterate through those in order to make commands using an algorithm provided by the TA.

With the commands successfuly made we then process those into a tree. We link these trees together to make a command stream

With a command stream made, we then iterate through the command stream to print out the contents of the tree.
